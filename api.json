      "full": "The Nian (年獸, \\\"Year Beast\\\") is a fearsome mythological creature from Chinese folklore that emerges at the end of each lunar year to terrorize villages. Described as a lion-like or dragon-like beast, the Nian would devour crops, livestock, and even people, representing one of the most enduring monster legends in Chinese culture. According to ancient legend, villagers discovered that the Nian feared three things: loud noises, fire and bright lights, and the color red. This discovery led directly to the protective traditions still practiced during Chinese New Year celebrations worldwide: setting off firecrackers, hanging red lanterns and decorations, and wearing red clothing. The Nian legend is not merely an entertaining story—it is the foundational myth explaining the origins of Chinese New Year customs. Every firecracker lit, every red envelope given, and every lantern hung during the celebrations can be traced back to the ancient community's successful defense against this monstrous threat."
