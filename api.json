      "summary": "A fearsome lion-like beast from Chinese mythology that emerges at the end of each lunar year to prey on villages. The Nian is repelled by loud noises, bright lights, and the color red, forming the basis for Chinese New Year traditions.",
      "full": "The Nian is a mythological beast deeply embedded in Chinese cultural traditions surrounding the Lunar New Year. Described as a lion-like or dragon-like creature, the Nian would emerge from hiding at the end of each year to terrorize villages, devouring crops, livestock, and even people. According to legend, villagers discovered that the creature feared three things: loud noises, fire/bright lights, and the color red. This discovery led to the traditions still practiced during Chinese New Year celebrations: setting off firecrackers, hanging red lanterns and decorations, and wearing red clothing. The Nian legend embodies themes of communal protection, the triumph of human ingenuity over monstrous threats, and the importance of cultural traditions in maintaining safety and prosperity. While modern celebrations emphasize joy and renewal, they still incorporate the protective elements rooted in the ancient Nian legend."
